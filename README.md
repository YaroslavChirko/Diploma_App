# Diploma_App
Basic CRM-like project.<br/> 
Can be used to form or discover groups for working on projects.<br/> 
Includes basic chat functionality and basic task scheduler.<br/> 
Users can be assigned arbitrary roles with flags to Allow/Disallow some actions.<br/> 
Uses Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Mail, JPA, Thymeleaf, jQuery and WebSocket technologies.<br/> 
The project is raw and in need of documenting, testing and some features,<br/> 
although it's highly unlikely that it will be worked on in future.
